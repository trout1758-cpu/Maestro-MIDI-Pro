MIDI Maestro ProCurrent Version: 1.0 Alpha (Manual Tagging Engine) 
Overview
MIDI Maestro Pro is a web-based application designed to bridge the gap between static PDF sheet music and digital, playable MusicXML/MIDI files. It is built for the musician who needs to digitize a piece of music quickly to hear how it sounds, without the tedious process of transcribing it note-by-note onto a blank staff in standard notation software.The core philosophy of this app is "Manual Tracing" (or Tagging). Instead of relying on expensive, hit-or-miss AI Optical Music Recognition (OMR), the user manually "tags" the notes on top of their uploaded PDF. The app then interprets these tags based on a calibrated staff system to generate a playable and exportable digital score.Core WorkflowUpload: User uploads a PDF of sheet music.Create Part: User creates a specific part (e.g., "Soprano", "Violin") to isolate the work.Calibrate: User enters "Calibration Mode" to define the top and bottom lines of the staff systems on the PDF. This grid allows the app to calculate pitch.Mark/Tag: User selects tools (Notes, Rests, Barlines, Clefs) and clicks on the PDF. The app "snaps" these clicks to the calibrated grid, ensuring accurate pitch and rhythm data.Export: The app compiles the tagged data into a standard MusicXML file, ready for playback in any major notation software (MuseScore, Finale, Dorico).Technical ArchitectureThe application is a modular Single Page Application (SPA) built with vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules). It relies on pdf.js for rendering.Key Modulesmain.js: The entry point that initializes the core systems.state.js: A central store for the application state (active part, selected notes, tools, calibration data).pdf-engine.js: Handles the rendering of multi-page PDFs into a continuous vertical canvas.zoning-engine.js: The math brain. It calculates where a user clicked relative to the calibrated staff to determine the pitch (e.g., "Clicked 10px above top line = High G").input-manager.js: Handles all mouse/keyboard interactions, including "Ghost Notes" (previews) and tool placement.note-renderer.js: visualizes the user's "tags" (notes, rests, symbols) onto an overlay sitting on top of the PDF.export-manager.js: The compiler. It iterates through the placed notes (sorted by vertical system and horizontal X-position) and generates valid MusicXML.Directory Structure/

"The Single-Part Mandate" A critical design choice in this version is Data Isolation.The user works on one part at a time.When "Soprano" is selected, the user only sees and edits Soprano tags. When "Alto" is selected, the screen clears (visually) to show only Alto tags.The export function combines all these isolated parts into a single score.Browser SupportDesigned for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Requires local server environment (Live Server) or generic web hosting due to ES6 Module CORS policies.
